Regarding depth estimation, the following is one of the handy repositories. This algorithm is implemented in PyTorch and some of our lab members use this algorithm in their research too.

[22:53, 5/3/2020] Awenindwo: The reason why I recommended PyTorch last time was that the majority of depth estimation algorithms are implemented in PyTorch. So you could use object detection and depth estimation in the same platform.
However, as a tool, YOLO is a great choice if you need accurate bounding boxes; So you could switch to it after a prototype software is made with PyTorch.
